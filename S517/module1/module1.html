<h1>The Folly of Prometheus</h1>
<h2>Sampo Jaakkola</h2>

<p>
As man craved for fire<br>
So thought <b>Prometheus</b><br>
Their need seems dire<br>
For he new well of mans lack<br>
As he hated the nights without<br>
a fire to warm ones back<br>
So he strode to the camps of men<br>
And lighted a blaze beyond their ken<br>
But the spark was not his to part<br>
Or so thought <i>Zeus</i>, the grand old fart<br>
Alone poor <b>Prometheus</b> now growls<br>
As an old crow eternally<br>
Eats his bowels.<br>
